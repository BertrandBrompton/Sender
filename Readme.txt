Introduction
==============
Sender is a chat client written in Java. I am using this project as a testbed to develop my skills in Concurrency and Network Programming. 

Installation Guide
====================
There will be a runnable .jar file for both the client and server. 

Known Bugs
=============
There are no known bugs at this moment in time. If you have found a possible bug, please send me an email about it to: beb2@aber.ac.uk and I will do the best I can to investigate the issue.

System Requirements
=====================
Given the lack of a powerful GUI interface, the system requirements would be pretty low. You would need at least a working internet connection as well as the JRE (Java Runtime enivonment).
